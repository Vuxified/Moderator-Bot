Current features:
  Can remove messages that have blacklisted words
  Can remove a message if it has been edited with a blacklisted word
 
Planned features:
  Strikes, essentially a way to track the ammount of bad messages a user has sent
  Banning a user if they reach a certain number of strikes
  Muting a user after they send a blacklisted word
 
Maybe features:
  Ranks, essentially a way to track the number of messages a user has sent and give them a higher rank the more messages they have sent
    Could be a good way to make sure a user is trustworthy before giving them certain permissions
  Ban users who have sent too many messages within a short period of time to stop somebody from botting a bunch of messages to get a higher rank
